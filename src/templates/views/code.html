<h1>Beginner’s Coding FAQs</h1>
<h3>What language should I learn first?</h3>
<p>Any object oriented language is a great place to start. Languages like Java, C++, and C# are all great languages that have very similar characteristics. They lay a good foundation for all other languages as well. If you do understand concepts in those C-based languages that knowledge will transfer to other languages. Maybe, some more than others, but the concepts will definitely be there and a version of the things you can do in one language will appear in another.</p>
<p>The downside to starting with those languages is that there is some overhead meaning setting up the language on your computer is going to take time, especially if you are not already tech savvy. If you are no used to fidgeting with the operating system, a Mac would be the way to go (check next question and answer for father explanation). So, if this is a concern for you, JavaScript is a great language to start as well.</p>
<p>There are some downsides with starting with JavaScript like its object oriented programming can be frustrating at first or not easily explained, due to it’s more complex setup compared to other OOP(Object Oriented Programming) languages based on C. That’s why it’s easier to understand these concepts in C-based languages first, but using JavaScript as a functional language is pretty straight forward and lots can be accomplished within that area as well. The beauty of starting with JavaScript is the easy setup. All you need is any text editor and a browser, you are good to go.</p>

<p>Some languages to be avoided as a first language are PHP and Ruby. There are nothing wrong with these languages, but knowledge gained in these languages can not be easily transferred compared to any C-based language. Setup can be a hassle as well especially compared to JavaScript. Also, JavaScript is much more straightforward in terms of seeing visually a change in code in terms of output. PHP and Ruby will probably require you to setup a development server environment on your system. This is not too difficult, but when you start out, it’s just best to get in there as quick as possible and start coding and not worrying about setting things up so much. Any barrier to entry for beginners or even experts to start coding projects is a hassle and best avoided if possible.</p>

<p>Also, if you know what type of program you want to build can guide you in the selection. If you want to build a native mobile application looking at Java or Swift would be a good choice. If you want to build an application for windows, then C# is the obvious selection. If you want to build a website or web-based application JavaScript can definitely come in handy. Although C#, Java, or PHP can come in handy at some point in the project. But, all things being equal starting a C-based OOP language would be the way to go, but you are worried about environment setup trying JavaScript would be a bad decision.</p>

<h3>What type of operating system should I use?</h3>

<p>First off, every operating system can be setup to program anything either it be mobile Android app to responsive web-based application. However, there is a caveat. If you know you want to program a IPhone application, then it is encouraged to use a Mac to program MacOS applications. Same goes for windows. There are ways around it, but it usually will necessitate using third-party unofficial programs to setup the proper environment. There is also less resources on the web to help you along the development process. So, doing some background research on what applications are other developers are using to program said type application, would be a smart decision. The more resources i.e. strong community around an operating system or program can make the development process so much simpler and easier. Less headaches is always a good thing.</p>

But barring those caveats, any operating system can be a good environment to program anything. There are strengths and weaknesses to any operating system. So, where to start? First, use the operating system you already have. If you have a computer already and it’s a Windows machine, use it. If it is a Mac, use it. If it’s a Linux machine (good for you), use it. There is nothing wrong with your machine. Anyone else telling you otherwise are just snobs and can be ignored especially in the beginning. Most beginner coding projects will not require a strong performance machine.
If you are just starting out programming and you have some discretionary funds for a new machine. Mac would be the way to go. Macs are super-user friendly. Setting up environments are way easier than Linux or Windows. You can get started on projects way faster because of the easy setup. The only downside for Macs is the price of hardware can be steep. If you can afford a Mac, just do it. It will serve most of your needs for the foreseeable future.
If you are good at installing, tweaking, and troubleshooting programs, then Windows or Linux are not bad options. The setup of some programs will cause more headaches. But, being able to customize your machine (especially in Linux) can be a great asset. Again, there is nothing wrong with your machine.
 What’s the best text editor or IDE?
For beginners, the best way to go is a text editor. IDEs definitely can and will speed up the development process in the future. But, when you are just starting out, getting to know the nuts and bolts of how coding works is more important than speed. Also, knowing what exactly is going on will aid in speed as well.
The two heavyweights in terms of text editors is Sublime Text and Atom. Although, Microsoft Visual Studio Code has come a long way. It is definitely making up ground in terms of popularity. There is no wrong or right answer. I, myself, prefer Atom. It’s free and it’s customizable. Two things I find more appealing than anything else. The only downside of Atom is performance. In comparison to the other two text editors, Atom can be slow especially during opening and closing. But, if you have a decent rig, it should not be too noticeable. I am also willing to give up performance for the sake of having everything set up like I want it, which is where the customizable comes into play. Atom is definitely the most customizable text editor out there with a growing community that supports it with an ever growing library of packages. I only see things getting better for Atom.
But, if performance is what you are looking for, giving Visual Studio Code is a good choice. It’s definitely the fastest. Ever since, Microsoft has been taking a more open-source approach in terms of development, Microsoft applications have been getting exponentially better. Visual Studio Code has a  clean interface as well and there are definitely a passionate fan-base out there. Give it a shot, if all this sounds good to you.
Last, but not least is Sublime Text. In terms of original gold standard, this is it. It has a long legacy of users. The community is the most devoted and largest. In terms of performance it sits in the middle of Visual Code and Atom. It’s faster than Atom, but slower than Visual Code. It’s also more customizable than Visual Code, but not as much as Atom. The only possible downside to Sublime is that after a free trial, you have to pay.
Again, there is no wrong answer. My personal favorite is Atom. But, having tried all three. They are all solid tools and you wouldn’t be wrong to prefer one over the others.
